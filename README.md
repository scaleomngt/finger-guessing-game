The player's data while playing the game is sensitive, We need to utilize zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that sensitive data remains encrypted and under the control of the data owner at all times. Aleo ZKML addresses this issue by integrating privacy into the smart contract layer. For third parties that require verification of user data, ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) smart contracts can be written to prove the correctness of computations without revealing the underlying data.
